"A list of goals (not features) is provided below:" CR LF
"- Hybrid kernel" CR LF
"	^ Mostly hybrid to obtain the benefits of both monolhitic and micro kernel"
" architectures" CR LF
"- JCL interpreter out-of-box; integrated tightly with the system" CR LF
"	^ JDA kind of replaces the JCL idea, but maybe a JCL wrapper could be done"
" that uses JDA as a backend?" CR LF
"- Integration with graphical windows management systems" CR LF
"	^ Would probably require some sort of VNC, and for VNC it requires a"
" fully working TCP/IP stack" CR LF
"- NetKernel-only operation (no graphical user interface and pure networking)"
CR LF
"	^ Aforementioned TCP/IP stack is required" CR LF
"- POSIX ports" CR LF
"	^ As long as it can be abstracted into the native system via some sort"
" of libc" CR LF
"- VAX/PDP ports" CR LF
"	^ Could be great, since those are also mainframes" CR LF
"- UDI integration with the kernel" CR LF
"	^ Mostly because UDI is currently unexplored on anything that is not x86"
" or x86_64" CR LF
"- RAM and CPU hot(un)plugging on the run" CR LF
"	^ Makes sense for a mainframe that might have +100 cores" CR LF

Translation-loakside-buffers are buffers storing the corresponding physical"
" addresses of a virtual address, this means that whenever the processor"
" wants to access a virtual address it will consult the translation-"
"loakside-buffer first in order to not recurse the entire page tree,"
" if it finds an entry corresponding to the virtual address it wants to"
" access it will not recurse the entire page tree, however if it fails to"
" find any entry corresponding to said virtual address then it will have"
" to manually recurse the entire page tree by itself until finding the"
" corresponding physical address to a virtual one, this is an expensive"
" operation which requires accessing multiple pages of data which can screw"
" things over a little bit, hence justifying the existence of translation-"
"loakside-buffers, once the processor has found the page entry it needs, "
"it will add it to the translation-loakside-buffer, these buffers are often"
" of a limited since so not-so-accessed entries gets discarded from it."
